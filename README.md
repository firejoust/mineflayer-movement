### Description

Mineflayer-movement is an alternate navigation plugin for mineflayer, enabling real-time terrain navigation without using a complex pathfinding algorithm. As opposed to discovering a predefined path, it behaves in the same way as a real player, using raycast heuristics to detect the environment within a certain range of sight. The plugin's heuristics can be used to modify the bot's behaviour, allowing it to respond to changing conditions and obstacles in real time. This makes it ideal for use in situations where pathfinding is not effective, such as PVP, following a player, etc.
