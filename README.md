## API
### Heuristics
- Heuristics calculate a cost for every direction, determining the most efficient direction of travel.
- Each direction will have a total cost defined by the supplement of all the heuristics that are used.
- Unlike A* implementations, a higher cost will actually correlate to a safer and more preferrable direction in this case.
```js
/*
**  Heuristic classes
*/

// The base class for a heuristic, being mutually inclusive with all other heuristics. Only required for creating new heuristics by extending itself.
bot.movement.heuristics.generic(options) /* valid properties: weighting */

// Determines a cost based on the difference between where the bot's facing vs. where it needs to face. Generally, smaller differences scale to a higher and therefore preferrable cost.
bot.movement.heuristic.proximity(options) /* valid properties: weighting */

// Evaluates the average distance from obstacles and determines a cost. A closer proximity will result in a lower cost (i.e. less preferrable)
bot.movement.heuristic.distance(options) /* valid properties: weighting, radius, sectorLength, count, pitch */

// Assesses terrain depth in order to discover the safest direction to travel. Unsafe (deep) terrain will correlate to a low cost, and shallow terrain to a high cost
bot.movement.heuristic.danger(options) /* valid properties: weighting, radius, sectorLength, depth, seperation */

options = {
  weighting: number, // The multiplier for a heuristic's final cost. Higher values will have a more considerable impact over the final costs.
  radius: number, // How far horizontally rays should traverse. Higher values dull reaction speed, however result in smoother avoidance.
  sectorLength: number, // The distance between block intercept checks on a ray. Smaller values increase reliability in finding intercepts, however result in slower performance.
  count: number, // (distance heuristic only) how many rays are cast vertically in a single direction. Higher values increase reliability in determining obstacles. The total collective spread between rays is 90Â°.
  pitch: number, // (distance heuristic only) The pitch offset (in radians) of the angle in which the middle ray is cast from. Influences overall where obstacles are detected, however should remain 0 in most cases.
  depth: number, // (danger heuristic only) How deep in blocks that depth rays should be cast. Higher values dull the urgency to avoid shallow holes.
  seperation: number, // (danger heuristic only) The distance between depth rays casted from the primary ray (if confused, see src/heuristics/danger.js). Smaller values increase reliability in determining an average depth, however result in slower performance.
}

### Movement
- "Movement" is technically done by the developer, however this plugin helps steer towards the safest direction.
- This is achievable by applying each heuristic in surrounding directions defined by the number of `rotations`.
- After accounting for all costs retrieved by directional heuristics, `evaluation` will determine the safest direction.
- The result is omnidirectional, continuous movement that does not rely upon a set path.
```js
/*
**  Movement/steering functions
*/

// rotates the player's yaw towards the safest angle required to reach the destination. Returns a promise.
async bot.movement.steer(destination, rotations, evaluation)

// returns the safest yaw angle required to reach the destination.
bot.movement.steerAngle(destination, rotations, evaluation)

// retrieves a record of angles to costs after being calculated by directional heuristrics.
bot.movement.costAngles(destination, rotations)

destination = vec3 // A position which the player must move towards. (https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-vec3)
rotations = number // (Default: 8) How many directions heuristics should be applied in, circularly. Higher values gather more information regarding the surrounding environment (Typically should be an exponent of two!)
evaluation = string // (Default: "cheapest") Which evaluation method to use whilst determining the final angle. Valid options are "cheapest" & "average".
